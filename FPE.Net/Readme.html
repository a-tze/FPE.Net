        This package implements one of the two methods for format-preserving encryption
        specified in NIST Special Publication 800-38G, Recommendation for Block
        Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods for Format-Preserving Encryption.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            The implementations focus on conformance, rather than on security or
            performance, and as such they may not be suitable for real-world use with
            sensitive data.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            At the time of writing, some attacks against FF3 have been rumored about.
            Therefore the algorithm has not been ported to .NET.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Common block cipher modes of encryption, such as AES, take fixed-length
        blocks of plaintext bytes as input and produce blocks of the same size
        ciphertext as output. Padding and block chaining modes allow block ciphers to
        be used to encrypt streams of data of arbitrary length.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some circumstances, e.g. when working with legacy environments, it is
        necessary to produce ciphertext in the same format and length, using the same
        set of symbols as the original plaintext. For example, a payment account
        number (PAN) consists of up to 19 decimal digits, with the first 6 digits
        used to identify the payment scheme and issuing bank, and the final digit
        used as a checksum using the Luhn algorithm. A card payment processor may
        need to encrypt these PANs in a way that the ciphertext retains some or all
        of the original attributes of the plaintext, so that systems designed to
        process the plaintext may also process the ciphertext.
    </p>
    <p>
        Format-preserving encryption (FPE) methods take strings of symbols as
        plaintext input, and produce ciphertext output of the same length as the
        input using the same set of symbols as the input. For the example above, this
        would allow a card payment processor to encrypt PANs yet retain the same
        format and structure in the ciphertext as in the plaintext.
    </p>
    <h1>Usage</h1>


    <p>
        The FF1 and FF3 methods operate on several parameters:
        <dl>

            <dd>
                radix, the range of integer symbols [0..radix-1] used in the input and
                output
            </dd>

            <dd>
                K, an AES encryption key

            </dd>
            <dd>
                T, an array of bytes used as an arbitrary "tweak," which is not
                necessarily secret but which extends and modifies the key

            </dd>
            <dd>
                X, an array of integer symbols, each within the range [0..radix-1]
            </dd>

        </dl>
        FF3 uses a fixed-length 8 byte tweak, but FF1 accepts an additional
        parameter:
        <dl>

            <dd>
                maxTlen, the maximum length of T; any length of T in the range
                [0..maxTlen] is accepted
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </p>
    <p>
        Both FF1 and FF3 output arrays of integer symbols, with length equal to the
        input length, and with each symbol in the range [0..radix-1].

    </p>

    <p>
        It is up to the caller to convert between arbitrary data formats, e.g.
        character-based data, and the arrays of integers that the FF1 and FF3
        functions use for plaintext and ciphertext input and output. For example, a
        caller might convert input using the symbols [0123456789BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXZ]
        (i.e. the character set for the Natural Area Code) into the integer symbols
        [0..29], and reverse the conversion using the output.
    </p>


    <p>
        The FF1 and FF3 methods operate only on uniform arrays of symbols where each
        symbol is in the same range. They do not preserve data formats where the set
        of symbols varies depending on the position within the input, such as for
        example a license plate number of one decimal digit followed by three upper
        case letters followed by three decimal digits. If necessary, the caller may
        transform such input into uniform symbols, then reverse the transformation to
        restore the original formatting.

    </p>
    
    <p>
        This implementation focuses on conformance with the algorithms defined in
        NIST SP 800-38G, with naming and structure closely aligned to the definitions
        in NIST SP 800-38G. As such, variable names in the code defy naming
        conventions in favor of the naming conventions used in NIST SP 800-38G.
        So, for example, we use "x" to represent an integer and "X" to represent an
        array of integers or bytes (i.e. bits), even though this does not follow the
        conventions. 
    </p>

    <p>
        NIST SP 800-38G uses mathematical symbols for some of its notations, which
        require alternative naming. In the implementation, these are replaced
        with descriptive method names. So, for example, the notation
        "&lfloor;x&rfloor;" becomes "floor(x)" in the implementation.
    </p>


    <p>
        In some places, NIST SP 800-38G uses superscripts and subscripts to specify
        additional parameters. So, for example, "STR<sup>m</sup><sub>radix</sub>(x)"
        becomes "str(x,radix,m)" in the implementation.

        <h1>Data Types</h1>

    </p>

    <p>
        NIST SP 800-38G is written in terms of abstract data types, for which we have
        chosen specific data types in the implementation.

    </p>

    <p>
        We use arrays of bytes in place of the bit string type described in NIST SP
        800-38G. This implies that bit strings must have a length that is a multiple
        of 8 bits, but this is consistent with NIST SP 800-38G. (In fact, NIST SP
        800-38G may have been clearer if it were written in terms of bytes rather
        than bits -- see ERRATA.txt.)

    </p>

    <p>
        We implement the numeral string in NIST SP 800-38G as an array of integers.
        The range of values for numerals in NIST SP 800-38G is 0..2<sup>radix</sup>,
        i.e. zero through 2<sup>2</sup>..2<sup>16</sup>, so all the values may be
        represented using 32-bit signed integers.

    </p>

    <p>
        Integers in NIST SP 800-38G are implicitly non-negative whole numbers of
        arbitrary size, so we represent them using the BigInteger class.

    </p>

    <p>
        As in NIST SP 800-38G, a block is a bit string (i.e. byte string) whose
        length is the block size of the block cipher (i.e. 128 bits or 16 bytes). We
        represent these as arrays of multiples of 16 bytes, without any special type.
        Note that the block size for AES, which is the approved block cipher, is 128
        bits regardless of the key size.
    </p>

    <p>
        As described in NIST SP 800-38G, a block string is an array of bits (i.e.
        bytes) whose length is a multiple of the block size of the block cipher. we
        represent this as an array of bytes with a length that is a multiple of 16
        bytes, again without any special type.
    </p>

    <h1>Native Functions</h1>

    <p>
        Instead of implementing new LEN(X) functions for bit strings and numeral
        strings, we use the Length property of the array type. For byte strings the
        Length property is the BYTELEN(X) value, and the value of LEN(X) is X.length
        8. (Again, there is an assumption in NIST SP 800-38G that bit strings are
        multiples of 8 bits.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of the mod calculation described in NIST SP 800-38G, we use the
        Math.floorMod(int) and BigInteger.mod() methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bit string conversion in NIST SP 800-38G is only used with constant
        inputs, so we sometimes use inline constants in place of the function where
        this can improve readability.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PRF(X) function used in FF1 is an implementation of the AES CBC mode
        without padding, followed by the extraction of the final block of the cipher.
        We have provided both the direct implementation of the PRF(X) function as
        Ciphers.prf(X) and an implementation that uses an AES Cipher object in
        Ciphers.prf2(X).
    </p>

    <h1>Unit Tests</h1>


    <p>
        The Unit tests are written to validate inputs and outputs using the sample
        data for FF1 and FF3 provided by NIST, as well as to provide code coverage
        and to fully exercise the functions. Sample data for FF1 and FF3 are 
        available at the examples page on NIST’s
        Computer Security Resource Center website:
